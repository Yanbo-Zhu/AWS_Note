# 1 DNS-Domain and DNS-Server

DNS-Domain:
DNS stands for “domain name system,” and DNS records hold the information about which IP addresses match which domains. 
就是 ip 对应的 dns name 都属参与 这个 ｄｏｍａｉｎｓ


DNS-Server: 
课可以被称作 Domain-sever， 
就是 具有 提供 dns-service 的 tool, 比如说 ms AD , aws route 53 , 装在了 这个 DNS-server 上 
如果是 MS AD,  他具有 domain-controller ， domain-controller 这个 application 去操作具体的 operate 


# 2 Hosted Zones

A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name. There are two types of hosted zones:

- _Public hosted zones_ contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet. For more information, see [Working with public hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)
- _Private hosted zones_ contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC. For more information, see [Working with private hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html).


# 3 Record 

## 3.1 A Record: URL to IPv4`

TTL (Time to Live)

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240219232439.png)

TTL 最高  24 hours, 最低 60 seconds 
DNS 的信息， 其对应的ip 地址， 保存在 user 端 ， 保存的时间为 TTL Period 的时间段 。 
For all Type of Record there is no default TTL Period value, but every Record must have TTL value, so you have to set it by user 

## 3.2 CNAME Record and ALIAS Record

# 4 NS 

name server record

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220205944.png)

name server record ist responsible for resolving your domain 
whenever a user form jhooq.org, this name server record will help is to resolve the request , 被选中的 每一行都是一个独立的 value, 不是一行。 
this  record in ns type 和 record in soa type were created by aws automatically when a hosted zone is created  

右边的 value/ route traffic 中的值 是 given by aws 





# 5 different Route 53 Type

## 5.1 simple routing

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220213433.png)

### 5.1.1 hosted zone 

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220210617.png)


![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220211920.png)


when someone tries to access that particular domain that request will be routed to the route 53 hosted Zone settings for jhooq.org 

jhooq.org 就部署在  one hosted zones which haben the value/ route traffic value 


### 5.1.2 created a record 

input the a static ip addresse 

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220212857.png)


## 5.2 Sample Routing with one load balancer 

use load balancer , the ip addreasss varies 
hide the all loadbalancer behind the Route 53, so you do not need to hard code the ip address of resource for our route 53

## 5.3 Weighted Routing with multiple load balancer 


创建一个 Weighted Route 53 ,
内涵两个 Record， 分别指向 两个 load balancer.。 要给出 每个 record 的权重

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020240220231858.png)


request from Sweden  will be directed to this load balancer  A

request from Finnland  will be directed to this load balancer B

## 5.5 Failover Routing 

if the primary fails, connect the secondary load balancer

# 6 Amazon Route 53 Resolver

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html

Amazon Route 53 Resolver responds recursively to DNS queries from AWS resources for public records, Amazon VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones, and is available by default in all VPCs.

## 6.1 Note
Amazon Route 53 Resolver was previously called Amazon DNS server, but was renamed when Resolver rules, and inbound and outbound endpoints were introduced. For more information, see [Amazon DNS server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

An Amazon VPC connects to a Route 53 Resolver at a VPC+2 IP address. This VPC+2 address connects to a Route 53 Resolver within an Availability Zone.

A Route 53 Resolver automatically answers DNS queries for:
- Local VPC domain names for EC2 instances (for example, ec2-192-0-2-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com).
- Records in private hosted zones (for example, acme.example.com).
- For public domain names, Route 53 Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers on the internet.

If you have workloads that leverage both VPCs and on-premises resources, you also need to resolve DNS records hosted on-premises. Similarly, these on-premises resources may need to resolve names hosted on AWS. Through Resolver endpoints and conditional forwarding rules, you can resolve DNS queries between your on-premises resources and VPCs to create a hybrid cloud setup over VPN or Direct Connect (DX). Specifically:

- Inbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries to your VPC from your on-premises network or another VPC.
- Outbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries from your VPC to your on-premises network or another VPC.
- Resolver rules enable you to create one forwarding rule for each domain name and specify the name of the domain for which you want to forward DNS queries from your VPC to an on-premises DNS resolver and from your on-premises to your VPC. Rules are applied directly to your VPC and can be shared across multiple accounts.
    

The following diagram shows hybrid DNS resolution with Resolver endpoints. Note that the diagram is simplified to show only one Availability Zone.

The diagram illustrates the following steps:

**Outbound (solid arrows 1–5):**
1. An Amazon EC2 instance needs to resolve a DNS query to the domain internal.example.com. The authoritative DNS server is in the on-premises data center. This DNS query is sent to the VPC+2 in the VPC that connects to Route 53 Resolver.
2. A Route 53 Resolver forwarding rule is configured to forward queries to internal.example.com in the on-premises data center.
3. The query is forwarded to an outbound endpoint.
4. The outbound endpoint forwards the query to the on-premises DNS resolver through a private connection between AWS and the data center. The connection can be either AWS Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN, depicted as a virtual private gateway.
5. The on-premises DNS resolver resolves the DNS query for internal.example.com and returns the answer to the Amazon EC2 instance via the same path in reverse.

**Inbound (dashed arrows a–d):**
1. A client in the on-premises data center needs to resolve a DNS query to an AWS resource for the domain dev.example.com. It sends the query to the on-premises DNS resolver.
2. The on-premises DNS resolver has a forwarding rule that points queries to dev.example.com to an inbound endpoint.
3. The query arrives at the inbound endpoint through a private connection, such as AWS Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN, depicted as a virtual gateway.
4. The inbound endpoint sends the query to Route 53 Resolver, and Route 53 Resolver resolves the DNS query for dev.example.com and returns the answer to the client via the same path in reverse.
