Cloud Front improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)  and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery )

Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP and UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for ==non-HTTP== use cases, such as gaming (UDP) , LoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic , fast regional failover.
